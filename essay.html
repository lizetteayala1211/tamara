        <p class="essay-start centered"> <i> &lt;deep exhale&gt; </i> </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="essay-quotes centered"> “Language is a circular shape around us. It has legs and sounds and blows and silence. Do you know this? It is a brick pulling out another brick and toppling down on top of itself only to be built back up again. Do you know this?” <i> &lt;emphasis added&gt; </i> <br> - Sable Elyse Smith, FTP – Fear Touch Police </p>
        <p class="essay-quotes centered"> “She agreed emotional wounds had no structuring capacity: though sometimes she picked her pain up thinking it could provide a strut or brick, it melted immediately in the warmth of her grasp into dark, liquid rot.” 
        <br> - Hannah Black, <i> Tuesday or September or the End </i> (32) </p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="essay-body">The brick is everywhere and nowhere. I learned this as a young punk, enamored with disruption, chafing against any kind of structure, and against all authority. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> I have never thrown a brick&mdash; not at a cop, not through a window, not in any of the ways made immortal by radical lore. I have held one, felt its weight in my hands, felt its roughness against my palms and known its potential: a potential taught to me by all the times I heard about bricks from others. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> The brick looms large in the political imagination: the first brick thrown at the Stonewall riots,1 a brick through a window, impenetrable brick walls that imprison us and divide us from our neighbors and loved ones. Once someone threw the first brick and it felt like the world changed. The possibilities shifted. A potentiality was activated. We heard about the first brick being thrown and believed that we, too, could do the throwing. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> The mythology of the brick is that it initiates resistance. The brick exists at the inception of <i> something different, </i> shaping the conditions for what follows. The brick gives form and energy to the first moment of movements&mdash; it is the straw that breaks the camel’s back, the initial crack in the breaking of the dam. It is imagining something into the future, something that this moment can shift. It is a fissure in the anticipated trajectory of our lives, a turn in a different direction.  </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> One element in the architecture of our systems, a singular brick exists differently alone rather than mortared in formation. Considering the brick in architecture recalls fortresses, carceral zones, structures meant to withstand fire and the test of time. In an era when words like “wall” and “border” deploy a particular violence, a wall of bricks is a specter, topped by razor wire and armed. Together, bricks form an impenetrable barrier. However, one brick alone regularly shatters the same. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> The brick invites us to meditate on the singular versus the collective. Alone, a brick has mobility. Alone, a brick can divest. A brick alone is already transgressive and outside of its use as a part of a whole; however, a brick remains in relation to that whole, to a larger structure in which it serves as a single element. Imagine a single brick in relation to a wall of bricks. What I ask us to consider from the tension between them is the way that movements, actions, and experiences are all in relation to larger systems. This is not to argue for the infallibility of the systems; after all, a wall can be demolished. A wall has edges and a start and end point. A wall can crumble with time. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> As I have conducted oral histories at the intersection of tattooing and the prison system, and being struck by moments in narrators’ stories that resisted and reshaped the conditions of their lives, I began to think of <i>bricks </i> as a conceptual embodiment of and visual metaphor for these moments and their effects outwards into the life preceding and beyond them. Here, a <i> brick </i> is at once disruptive and formative, destructive and foundational. It ushers in an alternative, at a point where the systems that hold us are still intact and without requiring a total divestment from or remaking of our worlds all at once; instead, the brick is a point of origin. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> I propose that bricks are sites of reorientation: places where change, a new possibility, a rerouting, can occur. Such moments may be illegible in that they are often small, deeply personal, and do not always materially transform a life or its conditions. What is significant about the brick moment is that it shifts the possible, “crack[ing] open the space of the sayable and the imaginable.2” The brick is not only in relation to present, past, and future simultaneously, but in relation with all systems that hold and constrain a person: a shift that is still in constellation with our worlds and the forces that limit them. </p>
        <p class="essay-quotes centered"> “The queer futurity I am describing is not an end but an opening or horizon. Queer utopia is a modality of critique that speaks to quotidian gestures as laden with potentiality. The queerness of queer futurity, like the blackness of a black radical tradition, is a relational and collective modality of endurance and support. The gesture of cradling the head of one’s lover, a lover one has betrayed, is therefore not an act of redemption that mitigates violence; it is instead a future being within the present that is both a utopian kernel and an anticipatory illumination.” <br> - Jose Esteban Muñoz, <i> Cruising Utopia: The There and Then of Queer Futurity </i> </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> Far from being fruitless or futile, these shifts are critical to transforming worlds. They are a point of departure from the systems that hold us&mdash; systems that often feel impossible in their enormity and daunting in their totality. The work of the brick is the endeavoring to find “some of the contours of the new world being built in the shell of the old 3,” as David Graeber writes. Honoring moments as bricks requires the releasing of a binary opposition between “free” or “unfree,” liberated versus subjugated, and honoring instead how change appears when movement is limited, without losing sight of utopian possibility. Though the brick may not transform these immediate worlds, it transforms the potential of them. Jose Esteban Muñoz names potentiality as a <i> “thing that is present but not actually existing in the present tense 4”. </i> The brick generates an otherwise5 , and is the change that makes way for the “anticipatory illumination” of a future. </p>
        <p class="essay-body"> While it is generally understood that both large-scale revolution and small-scale acts of resistance are reactions to inciting conditions or circumstances it is important to note the ways in which the openings for such actions are created. Here is where the brick exists. The brick is the sum of the set of circumstances that allow for redirection and a different outcome. The brick is not the action itself, but the rupture&mdash; the space that engenders the action. By noticing a distinction here, we do not deny the power of the individual to decide when and how to act, but instead see sites of possibility where we may not have seen them before. In recognizing that, we can begin to think of change that happens not only in spite of the mechanisms of oppression, but because of their slippage. </p>
